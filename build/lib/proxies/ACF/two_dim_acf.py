    '''
        Calculate 2D autocorrelation function:
            ACFs are calculated in sliding windows across entire spectrum.
            For 30-min cadence data, window size is 50 muHz and slides in increments of 10 muHz.
            Also, np.correlate is OK for 30-min cadence data.
            For shorter cadence data, window size is bigger and FFT based ACF is faster.
        
        Input:
            frequency :: list of frequencies in muHz
            power :: power normalized to relative power 
        
        Output:
            acf :: 2D AutoCorrelation Function
            freq_windows :: binned frequency list
                -> needed for plotting and collapsed ACF.
